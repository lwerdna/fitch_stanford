# Stanford's Fitch System Learning Tool

I really like [this tool](http://intrologic.stanford.edu/glossary/fitch_system.html) from [Stanford's Introduction to Logic Course](http://intrologic.stanford.edu/homepage/index.html). It's straightforward html and javascript with no frameworks or fluff. This goal of this repository is to preserve the tool and add additional exercises.

* The [Be-Fitched! Strategy Guide](./strategy.html) ([Stanford](http://logic.stanford.edu/intrologic/extras/fitch.html)) has very good advice on when to work forward from premises or back from goals.
